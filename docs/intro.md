> "The future of work will be a partnership between people, intelligent agents, and robots."

Welcome to the most exciting frontier in technology! This textbook will take you on a journey from understanding basic robotics concepts to building intelligent humanoid machines that can walk, perceive their environment, and interact with humans naturally.

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this book, you'll be able to:

- 🧮 **Master the Mathematics** - Linear algebra, kinematics, and control theory
- 💻 **Program Robots** - Python, C++, and ROS2 for robotics applications  
- 🔧 **Build Hardware Systems** - Sensors, actuators, and embedded systems
- 🤖 **Implement AI** - Machine learning, computer vision, and LLMs for robots
- 🦿 **Create Humanoids** - Bipedal locomotion, balance, and human-robot interaction

## Why Physical AI Matters

We're witnessing a revolution. AI isn't just software anymore—it's becoming **physical**. Companies like Tesla (Optimus), Boston Dynamics (Atlas), and Figure AI are racing to build humanoid robots that will:

- Work alongside humans in factories
- Assist elderly and disabled individuals
- Explore dangerous environments
- Perform household tasks

The demand for engineers who understand both AI and physical robotics is exploding. This book prepares you for that future.

## Prerequisites

Don't worry if you're new to robotics! I've designed this book to be accessible. However, you'll get more out of it if you have:

- Basic programming experience (any language)
- High school mathematics (algebra, trigonometry)
- Curiosity and willingness to experiment

## How to Use This Book

Each chapter builds on the previous one, so I recommend reading in order. You'll find:

- 📝 **Concepts** - Clear explanations with diagrams
- 💻 **Code Examples** - Runnable Python and C++ snippets
- 🧪 **Hands-on Projects** - Build real things
- ❓ **Practice Questions** - Test your understanding
- 🤖 **AI Assistant** - Ask the chatbot (bottom right) about anything!

## Let's Begin!

Ready? Let's start with [Chapter 1: Introduction to Robotics and AI](./chapter-01-introduction/) where we'll explore the fascinating history and current state of the field.
